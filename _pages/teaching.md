## Instructor

### National University of Sciences and Technology (2014-17)

* I was awarded the **Best Faculty Award 2015-2016**.
* Participated in curriculum design and outcome-based education (OBE) efforts in preparation for accreditation and continuous program improvement
* Designed and delivered lectures, labs, assignments, and exams for the following core courses in avionics engineering.

1. **AV 351 Modern Control Systems**
   - I taught using state-space methods alongside hardware experiments.
   - Students designed MATLAB controllers for inverted pendulums and cart-pole demonstrators, tuned them on real equipment.
    
2. **CS 201 Intro to Programming**
   - redesigned the course from Fortran/C++ to Python, introduced open-ended programming projects and emphasized algorithmic thinking.
   - Taught large class sizes.
   - introduced end-to-end app projects as the capstone deliverable, so students experienced problem framing, testing, and user-facing documentation.

3. **AV 101 DC Circuit Analysis**
   - Breadboard labs with power supplies, resistors, capacitors, and standard instrumentation made Kirchhoff’s laws concrete
   - Students were asked not only to compute but also to explain when measurements and predictions diverged and why.

4. **IE 361 Computer-Aided Instrumentation**
   - I rebuilt the course around hardware sensors, LabVIEW, and open-ended design.
   - Students developed instrumented systems, such as small data-acquisition setups, and presented them in a department-wide showcase.

## Teaching Assistant

### University of Colorado Boulder

* I was awarded the *Outstanding TA award (2023-2024)* and the *Best Mentor award (2022)* 

1. **CSCI 3104 Algorithms** - *Spring’22, Fall’22, Spring’23, Summer’23, Spring’24*
    - Led weekly recitations focusing on problem-solving strategies
    - Developed new recitation materials, quizzes and exams to reflect standards based asessment.
    - Co-created the material with Prof. [Divya Vernerey](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/divya-vernerey) and catering to around 300 students each iteration.
    - Some of my live teaching notes can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VJi3hquxz_v-bPqO5Xkz1I9KAOPdf28r/view?usp=sharing).
      
2. **CSCI 4622 Machine Learning** - *Fall’23*
    - Supported a project-based course that introduced supervised and unsupervised learning, with implementation in Python.
    - Guided student teams on scoping final projects, understanding model evaluation, and interpreting results.
    - Helped design and grade assignments involving regression, classification, and basic deep learning.
    - Introduced short weekly modules linking theory to practice, framing an interview-style question and then unpacking it together, so students could see how course concepts show up in real technical conversations.
    - The interview questions can be found at this [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14lf8eJgyUE1dg4MfZpCQLnfuApWYUdigTaOLaHOuhgc/edit?usp=sharing) .

### Oregon State University

1. **CS 562 – Software Project Management** - *Winter’18*

2. **CS 372 – Introduction to Computer Networks (eCampus)** - *Fall’18, Spring’19*
