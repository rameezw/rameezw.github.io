I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by Prof. [Sriram Sankaranarayan](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/). My research sits at the intersection of control theory, formal methods, and autonomous systems, with a focus on designing tools that make safety guarantees for robots and cyber-physical systems explicit, auditable, and trustworthy. Broadly, I’m interested in how we can move beyond impressive demos toward systems that come with clear explanations of why they are safe.

Before returning to graduate school, I spent several years teaching engineering courses, primarily in avionics and control, and working closely with students in lab-intensive, hands-on settings. That experience continues to shape how I think about both research and teaching. I care deeply about connecting theory to real systems, and about helping students build intuition, confidence, and practical skill alongside mathematical rigor.
