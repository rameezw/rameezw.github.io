I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by Prof. [Sriram Sankaranarayan](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/). My research brings together control theory, formal methods, and autonomous systems, with the goal of making safety guarantees for robots and cyber-physical systems clear, explainable, and trustworthy.

Before returning to graduate school, I spent several years teaching engineering courses in avionics and control, working closely with students in hands-on, lab-based settings. I care deeply about connecting abstract ideas to real systems and helping students build confidence alongside technical rigor. 

When I’m not thinking about research or teaching, I spend time with my family in the beautiful city of [Boulder](https://www.bouldercoloradousa.com/) and enjoy getting out on the tennis court whenever I can.
